Ayam Goreng Lembur Kuring Pusat,Jauhari Firman,3.0,(Translated by Google) Taste is ok but nothing special. Not really worth the price in my opinion. But it's still a good choice if you're looking for non-fast food in this area. At least the cleanliness and safety of our food is guaranteed. (Original) Rasa ok tapi nothing special. Tidak terlalu worth dengan harganya menurut saya. Tapi masih pilihan bagus kalau cari makan non fast food di wilayah ini. Paling tidak kebersihan dan keamanan makan kita terjamin.
Ayam Goreng Lembur Kuring Pusat,feriandi atmaja,4.0,"(Translated by Google) For chicken, the taste is quite good, it's more of a slightly dry type but not too dry. The taste is more of a salty type (for me). Then tempeh and tofu can be served in 2 pieces each. The taste is ok, but I prefer the tempeh. Sayur tamarind is delicious stuffed with long beans, chayote, peanuts, chunks of corn. The sour taste is there but it's not overpowering. The sambal is delicious, in my opinion, the type is sweet. Just because of the type of chili that is fried, the level of spiciness is not too spicy. For those who don't like spicy, it's perfect. For those who like spicy food, it will be exhausting. Iced tea is okay. Okay. As for the actual parking place, if for motorbikes, it's enough, just the place. But for a car, it's a bit cramped and limited. (Original) Untuk ayam rasa cukup enak lebih memang tipe agak ke kering tapi gak sampai terlalu kering. Rasa lebih ke tipe asin (bagiku). Lalu tempe dan tahu dapat masing masing 2 potong seporsinya. Rasa ya lumayan lah tapi lebih suka tempenya. Sayur asem enak dengan isian kacang panjang, labu siam, kacang tanah, potongan jagung. Rasa asemnya dapet tapi gak sampai terlalu overpower. Sambalnya yang enak menurutku tipe ke manis. Cuma karena tipe sambal yang digoreng maka tingkat pedesnya gak terlalu pedas. Untuk yang gak suka pedas pasti cocok banget. Bagi yang suka pedas pasti ngabis ngabisin. Es teh ya lumayan lah. Oke aja. Untuk tmp parkir sebenarnya kalau untuk motor cukup, lmyn tmptnya. Tapi kalau untuk mobil agak sempit dan terbatas. Kid-friendliness: Tempat terbuka dekat pinggir jalan raya harus hati hati bila bawa anak yang suka lari-lari. Gak ada pintu yang menahan anak. Parking: Kurang luas kalau untuk mobil"

Ayam Goreng Lembur Kuring Pusat,EW Tanto,4.0,"(Translated by Google) The taste of the chicken is sweet, both fried and grilled. The soup without any green vegetables contains bean sprouts, chicken and vermicelli, sprinkled with fried garlic. Garang tamarind is very spicy.

Rodjo Resto,Emma Nichols,3.0,"We went there during Ramadhan, booked a day in advance via WhatsApp, then went to the restaurant to ensure that our group orders were noted and would be ready for when we got there for Iftar (we gave some amount of money for the down payment). Tried to book a spot that we wanted but unfortunately it was declined saying that it was reserved already. We went there for Iftar to find out that our table was completely empty. Nobody approached us after a while, so I had to get someone to ask about our orders. Only then our drinks started coming out 1 by 1, they messed up with the dine-in and takeaway orders, some of the foods came out cold, some were OK, some took ages to come out. Note that the portions are very small for the price you pay, if you've got a sweet tooth then this is the place for you since the foods tend to taste sweet - which I personally like."
Rodjo Resto,Sylvia Rini Handayani,4.0,"Nice restaurant at the heart of Semarang. Easy to reach, near many city landmarks. There are common area for random guests and private area that can be reserved for special occasions. Food is good, specialty on the javanese fried chicken and sweet and sour fried fishes (ikan asam manis) Toilets are quite okay though need more rapid cleaning and brushing. Musholla (praying room) is outdoor which makes it hot. It also needs more maintenance. The dining experience is okay and the price is good. Okay for quick lunch in central Semarang for families in a medium budget who needs quick stopby."

The Hills Dining Restaurant,uud wicaksono,4.0,"Beautiful dining place on top of Semarang city, nice view of semarang. outdoor n indoor seating available. menu selections are also very nice, both western or indonesian cuisine.

In general, everything was good."

The Hills Dining Restaurant,Bramantyo Wicaksono,4.0,"The food was ok. It was pricy of course but hey, they sell both the food AND the view.

The Hills Dining Restaurant,Catlea Xmas,2.0,"The place is kinda nice but the food is really bad. It looks like a ""top"" eating spot but the food's qualities is so low. I could tell that everything is not made from scratch and by hands. I know they use instant products. And the taste is all over the place. My grandma could cook better. So for the foods with that quality, the price is too high. It is not worth it."
The Hills Dining Restaurant,Arjasa Virya,5.0,"If you‚Äôre looking for a place to have a romantic dinner with your s/o, this is the perfect place to have it. Reasonable price, good food, nice view. The most popular food right here is their long horn, 40 cm and 75 cm sausages."
The Hills Dining Restaurant,Robert Nichols,2.0,what a shame.... amazing location and that was about it. Zero atmosphere from the staff and the food was average. We only had desert but that was enough for me to post a comment. The place needs some restoration and to be modernized. The chocolate sunday was one blob of chocolate ice cream?? the brownie was small and defo wasn't home made and the Nacho's were a bag of crisps with some salad on the top. The staff didn't seem very happy. This place has so much potential but fell way short on this visit. Go there for a coffee and enjoy the view but that's it.

Pelangi Eatery,Rara,4.0,"Good restaurant to eat with family. Quiet atmosphere, good food and nice design. The waiter is also friendly, but that parking is difficult. Oh ya, yesterday I ordered salad and chicken karage, they taste really good :) And the slice cake is also worth a try too :)"

Pelangi Eatery,Richard Kawilarang,4.0,"Pelangi restaurant is located in south of Semarang which has a beautiful view, calm and atmosphere of a restaurant with an attractive interior. The food choices are varied and appetizing. The price is still affordable and worthty with good taste and presentation. For certainty the place should be reserved in advance. Limited parking space and be careful when parking in the basement because of the narrow lanes. There is also a souvenir and snack center with a selection of Semarang specialties. Restaurant recommendations as an option for hangouts or events with family"
Pelangi Eatery,Fredy Hartanto,5.0,"The place has 2 floor. The 1st floor is indoor and the 2nd floor has indoor facility and also an outdoor table and of couse a nice ambience. This place is quite busy at the weekend. The food taste is adequate and the size is enough (this means someone don't feel so full, but also also can't order 2 plate of main course). So you can still order spme dessert or buy something at the shop at the 1st floor."
Pelangi Eatery,Tri Armalia,4.0,"Ordered Crispy Duck with kecombrang rice. Portion wqs oke, but rice needs adding up a bit more. Escargot was delish!Tenderloin steak was ok, but too bad mashed potato was out of order. Apple tart was ok. Nice olace to chit chat, but a little suggestion, please add ice cream menu"
Pelangi Eatery,Rya Utama,5.0,"Delicious food and very good place for hangout. I was visiting this restaurant with family on weekend. Fortunatelly we have a reservarion before, since this is weekend, so the restaurant was full. For you who forget to do reservation, make sure to visit this restaurant before 6 evening for dinner. We didn't wait for long time for food eventhough the resto was full (10 minutes waiting is acceptable for me) I have tongseng (served with rice), my sister has nasi goreng wagyu (this is so gooood) and my mom has fried behoon (this is also good) The portion was large enough for big eater like us. The price is a bit high, but since the portion is large, so still acceptable. We also have red velvet cake and coffee. Everything was so good"
Pelangi Eatery,Galih SMG,5.0,"Pelangi Eatery at Tambora The menu is very diverse. Local, oriental, western dishes. Relative price. Also offers a coffee based menu at Hibiniu.

Pelangi Eatery,Christina Susilo,5.0,"Pretty architecture and interior, pretty view of Semarang atas as well. Really love their coffee from Hibiniu. Not really strong but smooth and floral.

Pelangi Eatery,Dinda Paulina,5.0,"Indoor space, there are specially smoking area and non-smoking area, available heavy food and snacks, for the beverage there are many sorts and there are non-coffee too. For a relaxing dinner with a couple or meeting friends is fun. The menu has a standard cafe average."
Pelangi Eatery,ChueCherry,3.0,"Food not really well for me - fried rice salty enough hahaha avocado coffee -wasn't quite blended enough. salmon steak- better to medium cook. milo cake - not really milo taste (cake base on pandan cake cream taste vanilla) Speciality this place for me is only chiffon cheese cake buy from the 'oleh-oleh Parking area quite enough. There are 3place in it (Pelangi Eatery, Hibiniu, and Oleh2)"
Pelangi Eatery,Ika Hapsari,4.0,"This restaurant is basically the premium version of Pelangi Restaurant that are already well-known in Semarang. Located in the good location around Gajahmungkur Semarang, the scenery is worth to try. The interior design itself is also modern. There are also gift shop and coffee shop, indoor and outdoor dining area in this restaurant. Very suitable to have meeting or office formal events. There are quite various dishes in the menu. The price itself is quite expensive in my opinion, but it depends on your budget. Because we can't forget the ambiance and the service they provide to give service excellence. They do the health protocol during Covid19 pandemic quite well. Will I go back here again? definitely yes"

Pelangi Eatery,Alan Burgess,3.0,"Was told to come here from friends, honestly it's OK nothing special, food took a long time to come and there were 4 of us, the meals did not come together, so by the time first meal finished my other daughter was still waiting for hers! I ordered the beef ribs 100k plus, there may have been 2 mouthfuls of meat and a small pile of new potatoes, meal was gone in 2 mins and I was still hungry, a waste of time. So I'm sorry itbmay be ok to hang out for a coffee, odly the restaurant was full, maybe the people were there like we were or maybe they just don't know good food! Not worth the hype in my opinion."

Pelangi Eatery,Kenneth Natanael,5.0,Pretty pricey but still worth it.
Pelangi Eatery,dragice yt,4.0,"Well... it just opened so the service is like flying flocks... but as long as u keep calling for service a senior staff will eventually get up to u. For me i prefer the hibinu cafe menu, cakes and cafe latte. Most of the food in the pelangi resto changes all the time (not stable), the pizza crust is too thin than it burnts easily so it gets bitter. The price is a bit high. So if u eat alot, prepare to spend a bit of cash. The place is very good for a meeting or catch up with friend n collegues."
